To write your own api:views.model.ViewModelProcessor[] you must implement the an interface and make Micronaut aware of its existence, for example, the

Here's a sample processor that ensures the rendering context always include a fictitious configuration object:

[source,java]
.src/main/java/myapp/model/ConfigViewModelProcessor.java
----
include::{testsSuite}/java/io/micronaut/views/model/ConfigViewModelProcessor.java[tag=class]
----

Please note that the ``@Singleton` annotation above is what makes Micronaut aware of this processor.

Micronaut itself uses this to enrich models with security related information.
